      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        I'm sorry that this website needs Javascript, but in my defense, I
        think I have a good reason.

      </p>
      <p>

        This website has an enormous amount of tiny pages, and maybe it's just
        my years with video games, but I really hate perceptible delay on page
        transitions... extra painful in this context!  So by making it a
        single-page-app with client-side routing, traversing links becomes
        instant.  It feels amazing to browse this way!

      </p>
      <p>

        But thinking about it, I see it's possible to provide the pages the
        traditional way as a fallback.  I'll get around to it eventually.
